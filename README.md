This is the repository for the SECOND (latest) Heatbox version created.

For a new user, start by downloading the "Guide" in /Guides/Guide and follow it to get everything working.


# HeatBox Beta
Code used to run the heating box:
- Standalone App used to run the heatbox (Only need this)
- Arduino code which is run from the Arduino IDE (developer only)
- ESP32 code which is run from the Arduino IDE (developer only)

Additionally includes:
- Written guide on how to assemble, install and operate the Heatbox
  
The written guide can also be found on the internal server at "INSECT lab\Marcus\Box".


PS.
Need to download "Firebase ESP32 Client" by Mobizt from the Arduino IDE Library Manager or from https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-ESP32 for the ESP32 Arduino ino-file to work.
